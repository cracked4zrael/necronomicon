### What's this for?
I'm a noob intermediate programmer, and around Chapter 9 of LearnCpp, I realized something, I could’ve learned most of the earlier fundamentals just by looking at clean, reference-style notes and immediately writing small programs (like a calculator, systems, etc.).

Since LearnCpp doesn’t really provide that kind of quick-reference material, I decided to make my own. This repo is a collection of simplified notes for people who learn like me, by looking at syntax references, experimenting with code, and picking up new features along the way.

Use this alongside your own research and LearnCpp itself to fully grasp C++.
